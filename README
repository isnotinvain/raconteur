=======================================Raconteur=======================================
My Senior Design project.

Raconteur's longterm goal is to be a lifecasting / blogging tool that helps automate
video blogging / lifecasting. It does this by:

	* Identifying who is in your videos and images
		- using face tracking and recognition (for videos and images!)

	* Analyzing trends in the location data of your videos / images

	* Splitting your life stream into blog post sized chapters that can be easily
	  published

For now I'm focusing on the face tracking and recognition in video.
