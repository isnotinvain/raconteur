Raconteur is my Senior Design project. It takes video, audio, and location
streams and builds an index of metadata from them using:
*Face Recognition
*Voice Recognition
*Voice to Text
From this index social networking / lifecasting type things can be done, as 
well as queries about one's life.
More detail to follow.
